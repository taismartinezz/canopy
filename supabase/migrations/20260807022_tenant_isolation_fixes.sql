-- Migration 022: Tenant isolation hardening
--
-- Findings from full RLS audit (2026-08-07):
--
-- HIGH:   invite_codes & sub_project_invite_codes have SELECT using(true)
--         → any authenticated user can enumerate all labs' invite codes + invited emails.
--
-- HIGH:   activity_feed table has no RLS at all (table predates tracked migrations;
--         migration 015 added a column but never enabled RLS).
--
-- HIGH:   notifications table has no RLS at all (same situation).
--
-- Fix strategy:
--   1. invite_codes — keep anonymous lookup by code value via SECURITY DEFINER RPC;
--      restrict direct table reads to own-lab members only.
--   2. sub_project_invite_codes — same approach.
--   3. activity_feed — enable RLS; project members see their lab's feed.
--   4. notifications — enable RLS; each user sees only their own notifications.
--
-- All statements are idempotent.

-- ── 1. invite_codes: restrict direct reads to own-lab members ─────────────────

-- Replace the "anyone can look up a code" SELECT policy with one that limits
-- direct table access to members of the same project. The join-flow (claiming a
-- code before you're a member) is handled exclusively via the RPC below.

    )
  );

-- SECURITY DEFINER RPC: returns only the fields needed for the join flow.
-- Callers who are not yet a team member (i.e., claiming an invite) use this
-- instead of a direct SELECT so we never expose the full codes table.
