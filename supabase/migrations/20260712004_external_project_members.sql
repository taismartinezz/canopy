-- ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
-- Migration: external project members + access-control
-- Adds: invited_email drift fix, sub_project_invite_codes table,
--       sub_project_members schema additions, literature_items sub_project_id,
--       and 12 additive RLS policy updates.
-- Safe to run on production: additive only; DROP POLICY IF EXISTS before each
-- recreate; IF NOT EXISTS on all DDL; no data destructive operations.
