-- Migration 001: Reconcile schema.sql drift against the live database.
-- These tables exist in production but were absent from schema.sql.
-- All statements use IF NOT EXISTS / ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency.
--
-- Drift discovered 2026-07-12:
--   - sub_projects, sub_project_members, bookmarks: live DB only, not in schema.sql
--   - tasks.sub_project_id: live DB already has it, schema.sql did not
--   - schedule_events: in schema.sql but NOT in live DB (live uses `events`)
--   - reminders.position, reminders.assignee_id: live DB only (pre-existing, out of scope)

-- ── Sub-projects ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Named groupings within a lab (project_id = the lab).
-- Members of a sub-project are tracked in sub_project_members.
